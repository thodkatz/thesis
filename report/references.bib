  abstract = {Cell biology is fundamentally limited in its ability to collect complete data on cellular phenotypes and the wide range of responses to perturbation. Areas such as computer vision and speech recognition have addressed this problem of characterizing unseen or unlabeled conditions with the combined advances of big data, deep learning, and computing resources in the past 5 years. Similarly, recent advances in machine learning approaches enabled by single-cell data start to address prediction tasks in perturbation response modeling. We first define objectives in learning perturbation response in single-cell omics; survey existing approaches, resources, and datasets (https://github.com/theislab/sc-pert); and discuss how a perturbation atlas can enable deep learning models to construct an informative perturbation latent space. We then examine future avenues toward more powerful and explainable modeling using deep neural networks, which enable the integration of disparate information sources and an understanding of heterogeneous, complex, and unseen systems.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell omics technology have transformed the landscape of cellular and molecular research, enriching the scope and intricacy of cellular characterisation. Perturbation modelling seeks to comprehensively grasp the effects of external influences like disease onset or molecular knock-outs or external stimulants on cellular physiology, specifically on transcription factors, signal transducers, biological pathways, and dynamic cell states. Machine and deep learning tools transform complex perturbational phenomena in algorithmically tractable tasks to formulate predictions based on various types of single-cell datasets. However, the recent surge in tools and datasets makes it challenging for experimental biologists and computational sci­ entists to keep track of the recent advances in this rapidly expanding filed of single-cell modelling. Here, we recapitulate the main objectives of perturbation modelling and summarise novel single-cell perturbation tech­ nologies based on genetic manipulation like CRISPR or compounds, spanning across omic modalities. We then concisely review a burgeoning group of computational methods extending from classical statistical inference methodologies to various machine and deep learning architectures like shallow models or autoencoders, to biologically informed approaches based on gene regulatory networks, and to combinatorial efforts reminiscent of ensemble learning. We also discuss the rising trend of large foundational models in single-cell perturbation modelling inspired by large language models. Lastly, we critically assess the challenges that underline single-cell perturbation modelling while pointing towards relevant future perspectives like perturbation atlases, multiomics and spatial datasets, causal machine learning for interpretability, multi-task learning for performance and explainability as well as prospects for solving interoperability and benchmarking pitfalls.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Current biotechnologies can simultaneously measure multiple high-dimensional modalities (e.g., RNA, DNA accessibility, and protein) from the same cells. A combination of different analytical tasks (e.g., multi-modal integration and cross-modal analysis) is required to comprehensively understand such data, inferring how gene regulation drives biological diversity and functions. However, current analytical methods are designed to perform a single task, only providing a partial picture of the multi-modal data. Here, we present UnitedNet, an explainable multi-task deep neural network capable of integrating different tasks to analyze single-cell multi-modality data. Applied to various multi-modality datasets (e.g., Patch-seq, multiome ATAC\,+\,gene expression, and spatial transcriptomics), UnitedNet demonstrates similar or better accuracy in multi-modal integration and cross-modal prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, by dissecting the trained UnitedNet with the explainable machine learning algorithm, we can directly quantify the relationship between gene expression and other modalities with cell-type specificity. UnitedNet is a comprehensive end-to-end framework that could be broadly applicable to single-cell multi-modality biology. This framework has the potential to facilitate the discovery of cell-type-specific regulation kinetics across transcriptomics and other modalities.},
