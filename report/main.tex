\section{Abstract}

With the recent advancements in single cell technology and the large scale perturbation datasets, the field of perturbation modeling \cite{jiMachineLearningPerturbational2021} has created an opportunity for a wide variety of computational methods to be leveraged to harness its potential. An overview of the methods that have been tested can be found on this study (cite the mini review). Multi-task learning is one of the methods that has been left unexplored in this field. In this study we aim to bridge this gap unraveling the potential of multi-task learning in single cell perturbation modeling.

\section{Literature review}


Among the tasks within the perturbation modeling, we will focus on the out-of-distribution prediction task. Explain the task.

%Studying the effect of external stimuli to the cell level, a field named as perturbation modeling, has a significant impact to the biomedicine sector and drug discovery. 

A review has been conducted to outline the methods and the datasets. One of the major tasks of perturbation modeling is the out of distribution prediction. 


UnitedNet has followed a multi task approach in a multi-omics datasets, showed the promising results of the method. scButterfly followed a cross modal architecture has proporsed its potential to perturbation modeling.
